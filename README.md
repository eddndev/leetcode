## About

This repository serves as a personal knowledge base for algorithmic problem solving. It maps the journey through LeetCode's extensive library, focusing on clean, efficient, and well-documented code.

The goal is not merely to solve, but to understand the underlying patterns—Graph Theory, Dynamic Programming, Greedy approaches, and more. Each solution is treated as a standalone study note.

## Repository Structure

To maintain organization and scalability across thousands of problems, the repository is structured by numerical ranges rather than arbitrary topic folders. This ensures a strictly ordered filesystem while allowing for topic-based tagging via internal file documentation.

### Organization Scheme

- **Source Code**: Grouped in ranges of 100 (e.g., `0001-0100`).
- **Naming Convention**: `ID-slug.ext` (e.g., `0001-two-sum.cpp`).
- **Documentation**: Self-contained within solution files or adjacent Markdown notes.

## Languages & Tools

Primary languages used for implementation:

- **C**: For raw performance and low-level control, honoring the roots of systems programming.
- **Rust**: For modern safety, concurrency, and expressive correctness. The primary vehicle for reliable solutions.
